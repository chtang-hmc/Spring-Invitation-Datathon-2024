2024-03-07,2,"During the pandemic, a shortage of semiconductors, chips that drove up the price of everything from cell phones to automobiles — and, by the way, we invented those chips right here in America.Well, instead of having to import them, instead of — private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America — creating tens of thousands of jobs, many of those jobs paying $100,000 a year and don’t require a college degree.In fact, my policies have attracted $650 billion in private-sector investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America.And thanks — and thanks to our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 46,000 new projects have been announced all across your communities.And, by the way, I noticed some of you who’ve strongly voted against it are there cheering on that money coming in."
2024-03-07,2,"At least, I hope you don’t.I’m taking the most significant action ever on climate in the history of the world.I’m cutting our carbon emissions in half by 2030; creating tens of thousands of clean energy jobs, like the IBEW workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations — ; conserving 30 percent of America’s lands and waters by 2030; and taking action on environmental justice — fence-line communities smothered by the legacy of pollution.And patterned after the Peace Corps and AmericaCorps [AmeriCorps], I launched the Climate Corps — — to put 20,000 young people to work in the forefront of our clean energy future."

1977-04-18,85,"You may be right, but suspicions about the oil companies cannot change the fact that we are running out of petroleum."
1977-04-18,85,"You may be right, but suspicions about the oil companies cannot change the fact that we are running out of petroleum."
1977-04-18,85, All of us have heard about the large oil fields on Alaska's North Slope.
1977-04-18,85,"In a few years, when the North Slope is producing fully, its total output will be just about equal to 2 years' increase in our own Nation's energy demand."
1977-04-18,85, Each new inventory of world oil reserves has been more disturbing than the last.
1977-04-18,85,World oil production can probably keep going up for another 6 or 8 years.
1977-04-18,85,Each American uses the energy equivalent of 60 barrels of oil per person each year.

1977-04-18,85,We waste more energy than we import.
1977-04-18,85,"With about the same standard of living, we use twice as much energy per person as do other countries like Germany, Japan, and Sweden."
1977-04-18,85, Our consumption of oil would keep going up every year.
1977-04-18,85,We can continue using scarce oil and natural gas to generate electricity and continue wasting two-thirds of their fuel value in the process.

1977-04-18,85," If we do not act, then by 1985 we will be using 33 percent more energy than we use today."
1977-04-18,85," We can't substantially increase our domestic production, so we would need to import twice as much oil as we do now."
1977-04-18,85,"Six years ago, we paid $3.7 billion for imported oil."
1977-04-18,85,Last year we spent $36 billion for imported oil—nearly 10 times as much.
1977-04-18,85," Unless we act, we will spend more than $550 billion for imported oil by 1985—more than $2,500 for every man, woman, and child in America."
1977-04-18,85,"Within 10 years, we would not be able to import enough oil from any country, at any acceptable price."
1977-04-18,85," If we wait and do not act, then our factories will not be able to keep our people on the job with reduced supplies of fuel."
1977-04-18,85," Too few of our utility companies will have switched to coal, which is our most abundant energy source."
1977-04-18,85,"We will have to have a crash program to build more nuclear plants, strip mine and bum more coal, and drill more offshore wells than if we begin to conserve right now."
1977-04-18,85,Intense competition for oil will build up among nations and also among the different regions within our own country.
1977-04-18,85,That is the concept of the energy policy that we will present on Wednesday.
1977-04-18,85, Our national energy plan is based on 10 fundamental principles.
1977-04-18,85,The first principle is that we can have an effective and comprehensive energy policy only if the Government takes responsibility for it and if the people understand the seriousness of the challenge and are willing to make sacrifices.
1977-04-18,85,Only by saving energy can we maintain our standard of living and keep our people at work.
1977-04-18,85,Our energy problems have the same cause as our environmental problems—wasteful use of resources.
1977-04-18,85,"We can protect ourselves from uncertain supplies by reducing our demand for oil, by making the most of our abundant resources such as coal, and by developing a strategic petroleum reserve."
1977-04-18,85,"We can protect ourselves from uncertain supplies by reducing our demand for oil, by making the most of our abundant resources such as coal, and by developing a strategic petroleum reserve."

1977-04-18,85,"producers deserve fair treatment, but we will not let the oil companies profiteer."
1977-04-18,85,"Conservation is the quickest, cheapest, most practical source of energy."
1977-04-18,85,Conservation is the only way that we can buy a barrel of oil for about $2.
1977-04-18,85,Conservation is the only way that we can buy a barrel of oil for about $2.
1977-04-18,85, The seventh principle is that prices should generally reflect the true replacement cost of energy.
1977-04-18,85,We are only Cheating ourselves if we make energy artificially cheap and use more than we can really afford.
1977-04-18,85,This is one reason that I'm working with the Congress to create a new Department of Energy to replace more than 50 different agencies that now have some control over energy.
1977-04-18,85, The ninth principle is that we must conserve the fuels that are scarcest and make the most of those that are plentiful.
1977-04-18,85,"We can't continue to use oil and gas for 75 percent of our consumption, as we do now, when they only make up 7 percent of our domestic reserves."
1977-04-18,85,"We can't continue to use oil and gas for 75 percent of our consumption, as we do now, when they only make up 7 percent of our domestic reserves."
1977-04-18,85,"We need to shift to plentiful coal, while taking care to protect the environment, and to apply stricter safety standards to nuclear energy."
1977-04-18,85," The tenth and last principle is that we must start now to develop the new, unconventional sources of energy that we will rely on in the next century."
1977-04-18,85, Our energy plan will also include a number of specific goals to measure our progress toward a stable energy system.
1977-04-18,85,These are the goals that we set for 1985:  —to reduce the annual growth rate in our energy demand to less than 2 percent;  —to reduce gasoline consumption by 10 percent below its.

2003-11-06,2,This strategy requires the same persistence and energy and idealism we have shown before.
1997-02-04,6,"We must build the second generation of the Internet so that our leading universities and national laboratories can communicate in speeds 1,000 times faster than today, to develop new medical treatments, new sources of energy, new ways of working together."
1997-02-04,6,"We must also protect our global environment, working to ban the worst toxic chemicals and to reduce the greenhouse gases that challenge our health even as they change our climate."
1997-02-04,6,"Together we must make the Chemical Weapons Convention law, so that at last we can begin to outlaw poison gas from the Earth."
1997-02-04,6,"All over the world, people are being torn asunder by racial, ethnic, and religious conflicts that fuel fanaticism and terror."

1990-08-08,7,Iraq is already a rich and powerful country that possesses the world's second largest reserves of oil and over a million men under arms.
1990-08-08,7,Our country now imports nearly half the oil it consumes and could face a major threat to its economic independence.
1990-08-08,7,Much of the world is even more dependent upon imported oil and is even more vulnerable to Iraqi threats.
1990-08-08,7,"These sanctions, now enshrined in international law, have the potential to deny Iraq the fruits of aggression while sharply limiting its ability to either import or export anything of value, especially oil."
1990-08-08,7,I will ask oil-producing nations to do what they can to increase production in order to minimize any impact that oil flow reductions will have on the world economy.
1990-08-08,7,And I will explore whether we and our allies should draw down our strategic petroleum reserves.
1990-08-08,7,And one more thing: I'm asking the oil companies to do their fair share.
1974-02-25,43,"The President: Ladies and gentlemen, before going to your questions, I have a brief report on the energy situation, the progress we have made to date, and also the problems that we have in the future."

1974-02-25,43,I asked him if he was having any trouble getting gas.
1974-02-25,43,"Actually, I had zero in the tank.""  I have seen this problem as I have driven around in the Miami area and also in the Washington area—the gas lines, the fact, too, that in the Eastern States generally we do have a problem of shortage of gasoline, which has been, of course, very difficult for many people going to work, going to school, or what have you."

1974-02-25,43," Mr. Simon last week, as you know, at my direction allocated additional gasoline for these particular areas, and he is prepared to take more action in the future to deal with this problem."
1974-02-25,43," As far as the entire situation is concerned, I am able to report tonight that as a result of the cooperation of the American people, as a result, too, of our own energy conservation program within the Government, that I now believe confidently that there is much better than an even chance that there will be no need for gas rationing in the United States."

1974-02-25,43,"Now this, of course, would be immediately popular, but it would mean, if we did have such a rollback, that we would not only have more and longer gas lines, but a rollback of prices would lead to shortages which would require, without question, rationing all over the country."
1974-02-25,43," And that is why I again urge the Congress to act responsibly on the measures that we have presented to the Congress to deal with the problem of price and profits through the windfall profits measure that we have submitted and to deal with the problem of gas shortage overall by getting more supplies, and that means the deregulation of natural gas so that it is competitive as far as price is concerned; the amendment of some of our environmental actions so that we can use more coal and thereby take some of the pressure off of the demands for gasoline and other fuels; the deepwater ports; and the other measures that I have mentioned on many occasions to the Nation and also before members of the press."

1974-02-25,43,"And our goal of becoming completely independent in energy, independent of any foreign source, is one that we can achieve, but it will require the continued cooperation of the American people, which I am sure we will get, and responsible action by the Congress, action directed not simply toward distributing a shortage and making it worse, but action which will increase supplies and thereby get rid of the shortage."
1974-02-25,43,One is in the field of energy.
1974-02-25,43,The way to get at the source of the problem in the field of energy is to increase supplies.
1974-02-25,43," With regard to inflation, I should point out, too, that almost two-thirds of the price increase, the increase in prices last year, which was at a very high rate, was due to energy and also to the problem of food."
1974-02-25,43,"It is also going to take an effort on the part of our farmers, an effort on the part of the Administration in the field of energy and the rest, so that we can get the supplies up, because the answer to higher prices is not simply controls."
1974-02-25,43,"Mr. President, I would like to follow up on your discussion of the energy situation."
1974-02-25,43,"When you said that the crisis is ended, that the problem is still with us, I think for most people the problem is waiting for a long time in line for gasoline, and another part of it is the price of gasoline going up, as it has been."

1974-02-25,43, The President: I believe that the lines for gasoline will become shorter in the spring and summer months.
1974-02-25,43," As far as the price of gasoline is concerned, I would be less than candid if I were not to say that the price of gasoline is not going to go down until more supplies of gasoline come into the country and also until other fuels come on stream which will reduce the pressure which is upward on the price of gasoline."

1974-02-25,43," Obviously, too, when the embargo is lifted, that is and will have some effect on the price of gasoline."
1974-02-25,43," The President: The embargo question is one that I know is on the minds of all of us, and it is one that presently is under consideration, as you know, by the oil-producing countries."
1974-02-25,43, If I could perhaps elaborate just a bit on that: As far as the oil-producing countries are concerned we believe it is in their interest to lift the embargo.
1974-02-25,43,And it is because I believe that we are going to make progress in developing those particular items that are essential towards movement toward a permanent peace in the Mideast that the oil-producing countries will conclude that they should move on the embargo front.
1974-02-25,43," Q: Mr. President, the Shah of Iran said in an interview that the United States is getting as much oil now as it did before the embargo, and Mr. Simon of the Federal Energy Office said that such a statement is irresponsible and reckless."
1974-02-25,43,"Are we getting as much oil, and why would the Shah say this?"
1974-02-25,43, We are getting substantially less from the oil-producing countries in the Mideast than we were before the embargo.
1974-02-25,43,"They are good, because we are going to be dealing with the energy crisis-what was a crisis—as a problem."
1974-02-25,43, We will not stand by and allow this country—because of the energy crisis and because of some of the problems we have had on the inflation front—stand by and allow a recession to occur.

1975-05-27,61," February, March, April, May—as of now, the Congress has done nothing positive to end our energy dependence."
1975-05-27,61," On the contrary, it has taken two negative actions: the first, an attempt to prevent the President from doing anything on his own, the second, to pass a strip mining bill which would reduce domestic coal production instead of increasing it, put thousands of people out of work, needlessly increase the cost of energy to consumers, raise electric bills for many, and compel us to import more foreign oil, not less."

1977-11-08,82," One problem is that the price of all energy is going up, both because of its increasing scarcity and because the price of oil is not set in a free and competitive market."
1977-11-08,82," One problem is that the price of all energy is going up, both because of its increasing scarcity and because the price of oil is not set in a free and competitive market."
1977-11-08,82,The world price is set by a foreign cartel—the governments of the so-called OPEC nations.
1977-11-08,82," Our biggest problem, however, is that we simply use too much and waste too much energy."
1977-11-08,82,"Since the great price rise in 1973, the Japanese have cut their oil imports, the Germans, the French, the British, the Italians have all cut their oil imports."
1977-11-08,82,"Meanwhile, although we have large petroleum supplies of our own and most of them don't, we in the United States have increased our imports more than 40 percent."
1977-11-08,82,"Ten years ago, when foreign oil was cheap, we imported just 2 1/2 million barrels of oil a day, about 20 percent of what we used."

1977-11-08,82," There are three things that we must do to avoid this danger: first, cut back on consumption; second, shift away from oil and gas to other sources of energy; and third, encourage production of energy here in the United States."

1977-11-08,82,These are the purposes of the new energy legislation.
1977-11-08,82," In order to conserve energy, the Congress is now acting to make our automobiles, our homes, and appliances more efficient and to encourage industry to save both heat and electricity."
1977-11-08,82," The congressional conference committees are now considering changes in how electric power rates are set in order to discourage waste, to reward those who use less energy, and to encourage a change in the use of electricity to hours of the day when demand is low."
1977-11-08,82," Another very important question before Congress is how to let the market price for domestic oil go up to reflect the cost of replacing it while, at the same time, protecting the American consumers and our own economy."
1977-11-08,82, We must face an unpleasant fact about energy prices.
1977-11-08,82,"They are going up, whether we pass an energy program or not, as fuel becomes more scarce and more expensive to produce."
1977-11-08,82,"They are going up, whether we pass an energy program or not, as fuel becomes more scarce and more expensive to produce."
1977-11-08,82,"The question is, who should benefit from those rising prices for oil already discovered?"
1977-11-08,82,"Our energy plan captures and returns them to the public, where they can stimulate the economy, save more energy, and create new jobs."
1977-11-08,82," We will use research and development projects, tax incentives and penalties, and regulatory authority to hasten the shift from oil and gas to coal, to wind and solar power, to geothermal, methane, and other energy sources."

1977-11-08,82," We've also proposed, and the Congress is reviewing, incentives to encourage production of oil and gas here in our own country."
1977-11-08,82, It's important that we promote new oil and gas discoveries and increased production by giving adequate prices to the producers.
1977-11-08,82, It's important that we promote new oil and gas discoveries and increased production by giving adequate prices to the producers.
1977-11-08,82," We've recommended that the price, for instance, of new natural gas be raised each year to the average price of domestic oil that would produce the same amount of energy."

1977-11-08,82," We've recommended that the price, for instance, of new natural gas be raised each year to the average price of domestic oil that would produce the same amount of energy."
1977-11-08,82,"With this new policy, the gross income of gas producers would average about $2 billion each year more than at the present price level."
1977-11-08,82,New oil prices would also rise in 3 years to the present world level and then be increased annually to keep up with inflation.
1977-11-08,82,This incentive for new oil production would be the highest in the whole world.
1977-11-08,82," These proposals would provide adequate incentives for exploration and production of domestic oil and gas, but some of the oil companies want much more—tens of billions of dollars more."

1977-11-08,82,"They want immediate and permanent deregulation of gas prices, which would cost consumers $70 billion or more between now and 1985."
1977-11-08,82,"They want even higher prices than those we've proposed for ""new"" gas and oil, and they want the higher prices sooner."
1977-11-08,82,"They want even higher prices than those we've proposed for ""new"" gas and oil, and they want the higher prices sooner."
1977-11-08,82,"We should reward individuals and companies who discover and produce new oil and gas, but we must not give them huge windfall profits on their existing wells at the expense of the American people."
1977-11-08,82,"We should reward individuals and companies who discover and produce new oil and gas, but we must not give them huge windfall profits on their existing wells at the expense of the American people."
1977-11-08,82, Now the energy proposal that I made to Congress last April has three basic elements to ensure that it is well balanced.
1977-11-08,82,"First, it's fair both to the American consumers and to the energy producers, and it will not disrupt our national economy."
1977-11-08,82,"Second, as I've said before, it's designed to meet our important goals for energy conservation, to promote a shift to more plentiful and permanent energy supplies and encourage increased production of energy in the United States."
1977-11-08,82,I will sign the energy bills only if they meet these tests.
1977-11-08,82," I'm convinced that we can have enough energy to permit the continued growth of our economy, to expand production and jobs, and to protect the security of the United States—if we act wisely."
1977-11-08,82,I hope that each of you will take steps to conserve our precious energy and also join with your elected officials at all levels of government to meet this test of our Nation's judgment and will.
1977-11-08,82,But our energy plan also reflects the optimism that I feel about our ability to deal with these problems.
1977-11-08,82,"This energy plan is a good insurance policy—for the future, in which relatively small premiums that we pay today will protect us in the years ahead."
1977-11-08,82,"But if we fail to act boldly today, then we will surely face a greater series of crises tomorrow—energy shortages, environmental damage, ever more massive Government bureaucracy and regulations, and illconsidered, last-minute crash programs."
1977-11-08,82," I hope that, perhaps a hundred years from now, the change to inexhaustible energy sources will have been made, and our Nation's concern about energy will be over."
2010-11-03,17," But what I think the American people are expecting, and what we owe them, is to focus on those issues that affect their jobs, their security, and their future:  reducing our deficit, promoting a clean energy economy, making sure that our children are the best educated in the world, making sure that we’re making the investments in technology that will allow us to keep our competitive edge in the global economy."
2010-11-03,17, I don’t think there’s anybody in America who thinks that we’ve got an energy policy that works the way it needs to; that thinks that we shouldn’t be working on energy independence.
2010-11-03,17," And that gives opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to come together and think about, whether it’s natural gas or energy efficiency or how we can build electric cars in this country, how do we move forward on that agenda."
2010-11-03,17," And that gives opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to come together and think about, whether it’s natural gas or energy efficiency or how we can build electric cars in this country, how do we move forward on that agenda."
2010-11-03,17," I don’t think we should be cutting back on research and development, because if we can develop new technologies in areas like clean energy, that could make all the difference in terms of job creation here at home."
2010-11-03,17, Let me give you an example -- the issue of energy that I just mentioned.
2010-11-03,17,    I think there are a lot of Republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the House last year.
2010-11-03,17, But that doesn't mean there isn't agreement that we should have a better energy policy.
2010-11-03,17,"  We’ve got, I think, broad agreement that we’ve got terrific natural gas resources in this country."
2010-11-03,17,  There's been discussion about how we can restart our nuclear industry as a means of reducing our dependence on foreign oil and reducing greenhouse gases.
2010-11-03,17,  There's been discussion about how we can restart our nuclear industry as a means of reducing our dependence on foreign oil and reducing greenhouse gases.
2010-11-03,17,"  We were able, over the last two years, to increase for the first time in 30 years fuel-efficiency standards on cars and trucks."
2010-11-03,17,"  So I think when it comes to something like energy, what we’re probably going to have to do is say here are some areas where there's just too much disagreement between Democrats and Republicans, we can’t get this done right now, but let’s not wait."
2010-11-03,17,"    With respect to the EPA, I think the smartest thing for us to do is to see if we can get Democrats and Republicans in a room who are serious about energy independence and are serious about keeping our air clean and our water clean and dealing with the issue of greenhouse gases -- and seeing are there ways that we can make progress in the short term and invest in technologies in the long term that start giving us the tools to reduce greenhouse gases and solve this problem."

2010-11-03,17,  The EPA is under a court order that says greenhouse gases are a pollutant that fall under their jurisdiction.
2010-11-03,17,"And I think one of the things that's very important for me is not to have us ignore the science, but rather to find ways that we can solve these problems that don’t hurt the economy, that encourage the development of clean energy in this country, that, in fact, may give us opportunities to create entire new industries and create jobs that -- and that put us in a competitive posture around the world."

1976-10-06,18,"Would you be willing to risk an oil embargo in order to promote human rights in Iran, Saudi Arabia--withhold arms from Saudi Arabia for the same purpose?"
1976-10-06,18,"For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our Nation on oil, I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war."

1976-10-06,18,"It would have been inconceivable 10, 15 years ago for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo."
1976-10-06,18,"If I understand you correctly, you would, in fact, to use my examples, withhold arms from Iran and Saudi Arabia even if the risk was an oil embargo and if they should be securing those arms from somewhere else."
1976-10-06,18,"But if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war."
1976-10-06,18,"I think under those circumstances, they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with the previous oil embargo."
1976-10-06,18,"In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate; Iran continued to sell oil to the United States."
1976-10-06,18,"I advocated last May, in a speech at the United Nations, that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices, that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives."

1993-02-17,8," Our plan does include a broad-based tax on energy, and I want to tell you why I selected this and why I think it's a good idea."
1993-02-17,8,"I recommend that we adopt a Btu tax on the heat content of energy as the best way to provide us with revenue to lower the deficit because it also combats pollution, promotes energy efficiency, promotes the independence, economically, of this country as well as helping to reduce the debt, and because it does not discriminate against any area."
1993-02-17,8,"Unlike a carbon tax, that's not too hard on the coal States; unlike a gas tax, that's not too tough on people who drive a long way to work; unlike an ad valorem tax, it doesn't increase just when the price of an energy source goes up."

1993-02-17,8," I would also point out what the American people already know, and that is, because we're a big, vast country where we drive long distances, we have maintained far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country."
1993-02-17,8,We will still have far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country.

1976-08-19,4,There are cynics who say that a party platform is something that no one bothers to read and is doesn't very often amount to much.
1976-08-19,4,"Whether it is different this time than is has ever been before, I believe the Republican party has a platform that is a banner of bold, unmistakable colors with no pale pastel shades."

1976-08-19,4,"And a call to us to really be successful in communicating and reveal to the American people the difference between this platform and the platform of the opposing party which is nothing but a revamp and a reissue and a rerunning of a late, late show of the thing that we have been hearing from them for the last 40 years."

1976-09-23,34,We have just advocated this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy.
1976-09-23,34,Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.
1976-09-23,34,"We have 20 different agencies in the Federal Government responsible for the production, the regulation, the information about energy, the conservation of energy spread all over Government."
1976-09-23,34,"In your energy plan, you consolidate a number of agencies into one, or you would, but does that really change the overall?"

1976-09-23,34,But the energy policy of our Nation is one that has not yet been established under this administration.
1976-09-23,34,I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us.
1976-09-23,34,We've got to have a firm way to handle the energy question.
1976-09-23,34,"In addition to that, we need to have a realization that we've got about 35 years worth of oil left in the whole world."
1976-09-23,34,We are going to run out of oil.

1976-09-23,34,"There ought to be a full-time atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company, in the control room full-time, 24 hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops."
1976-09-23,34,"So, shift from oil to coal; emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power; strict conservation measures-not yield every time the special interest groups put pressure on the President, like this administration has done; and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions."

1976-09-23,34,That's the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.
1976-09-23,34,"Well, Governor, on the same subject, would you require mandatory conservation efforts to try to conserve fuel?"
1976-09-23,34,"And some major manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have, through very effective efficiency mechanisms, cut down the use of energy by as much as 40 percent with the same out-product."
