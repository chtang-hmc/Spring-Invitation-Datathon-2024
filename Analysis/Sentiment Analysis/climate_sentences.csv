2017-01-10,6,"But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all and not just some.If I had told you 8 years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history; if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, take out the mastermind of 9/11; if I had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens—if I had told you all that, you might have said our sights were set a little too high."

1983-03-23,18,"It took one kind of military force to deter an attack when we had far more nuclear weapons than any other power; it takes another kind now that the Soviets, for example, have enough accurate and powerful nuclear weapons to destroy virtually all of our missiles on the ground."

1989-01-11,5,Not only have the superpowers actually begun to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons—and hope for even more progress is bright—but the regional conflicts that rack the globe are also beginning to cease.
1989-01-11,5,"The past few days when I've been at that window upstairs, I've thought a bit of the ""shining city upon a hill."" The phrase comes from John Winthrop, who wrote it to describe the America he imagined."
1989-01-11,5,"But in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity."

1988-01-25,8,"Yet if the Congress and the administration work together, even greater opportunities lie ahead to expand a growing world economy, to continue to reduce the threat of nuclear arms, and to extend the frontiers of freedom and the growth of democratic institutions."

1974-02-25,5," In a nutshell, this is what we have to consider: Do we want to go back to a period when the United States and the Soviet Union, the two great super powers, stood in confrontation against each other and risk a runaway nuclear arms race and also crisis in Berlin, in the Mideast, even again in Southeast Asia or other places of the world, or do we want to continue on a path in which we recognize our differences but try to recognize also the fact that we must either live together or we will all die together?"

1983-03-08,6,I repeat: America is in the midst of a spiritual awakening and a moral renewal.
1983-03-08,6,"I intend to do everything I can to persuade them of our peaceful intent, to remind them that it was the West that refused to use its nuclear monopoly in the forties and fifties for territorial gain and which now proposes 50-percent cut in strategic ballistic missiles and the elimination of an entire class of land-based, intermediate-range nuclear missiles."
1983-03-08,6,But we can assure none of these things America stands for through the so-called nuclear freeze solutions proposed by some.
1983-03-08,6,"So, in your discussions of the nuclear freeze proposals, I urge you to beware the temptation of pride—the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire, to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil."
1983-03-08,6,"I ask you to resist the attempts of those who would have you withhold your support for our efforts, this administration's efforts, to keep America strong and free, while we negotiate real and verifiable reductions in the world's nuclear arsenals and one day, with God's help, their total elimination."

1981-11-18,16,"No NATO weapons, conventional or nuclear, will ever be used in Europe except in response to attack."
1981-11-18,16,But the momentum of the continuing Soviet military buildup threatens both the conventional and the nuclear balance.
1981-11-18,16,"During a period when NATO deployed no new intermediate-range nuclear missiles and actually withdrew 1,000 nuclear warheads, the Soviet Union deployed more than 750 nuclear warheads on the new SS20 missiles alone."
1981-11-18,16,I would like to discuss more specifically the growing threat to Western Europe which is posed by the continuing deployment of certain Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
1981-11-18,16,"Rather, it provides a vital link between conventional shorter-range nuclear forces in Europe and intercontinental forces in the United States."
1981-11-18,16,"So, we and our allies are proceeding to modernize NATO's nuclear forces of intermediate range to meet increased Soviet deployments of nuclear systems threatening Western Europe."

1981-11-18,16,"During the past 6 years while the United States deployed no new intermediate-range missiles and withdrew 1,000 nuclear warheads from Europe, the Soviet Union deployed 750 warheads on mobile, accurate ballistic missiles."
1981-11-18,16,The Soviets assert that a balance of intermediate range nuclear forces already exists.
1981-11-18,16,"Well, as this map demonstrates, the SS-20s, even if deployed behind the Urals, will have a range that puts almost all of Western Europe-the great cities-Rome, Athens, Paris, London, Brussels, Amsterdam, Berlin, and so many more-all of Scandinavia, all of the Middle East, all of northern Africa, all within range of these missiles which, incidentally, are mobile and can be moved on shorter notice."

1996-11-03,3," We know that we're breaking down the frontiers of ignorance in so many ways that will help us to cure cancer, that will help us to find ways to grow our economy while we improve our environment, that will help us to find ways to create jobs for people who have never been able to get them before."
1996-11-03,3,And think what a blessing it is that you are anchored in what you believe and that you are not subject to the wild winds that often blow through the airwaves at election time.

1980-10-28,41,"One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope we'll get to later on, because that's the most important single issue in this campaign."
1980-10-28,41,"Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One, conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well — more coal this year than ever before in history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history."
1980-10-28,41,"It looks like a bombed-out city — great, gaunt skeletons of buildings, windows smashed out, painted on one of them ""Unkept promises,"" on another, ""Despair."" And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this area."
1980-10-28,41,"We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the Governors, and other interested officials."
1980-10-28,41,"Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country."
1980-10-28,41,"There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown, central cities, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel-efficient, with a chance for a synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends."
1980-10-28,41,Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons in countries like Libya or Iraq.
1980-10-28,41,"We have even alienated some of our closest trade partners, because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries."
1980-10-28,41,"When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes a very disturbing comment that nonproliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business."
1980-10-28,41,"Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office, not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives."
1980-10-28,41,"I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation, and nuclear proliferation, or the trying to halt it, would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine."
1980-10-28,41,"Governor Reagan, arms control: The President said it was the single most important issue, Both of you have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms race with Russia, but by methods that are vastly different."
1980-10-28,41,"The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons, and his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite yet."
1980-10-28,41,"Both of you have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms race with Russia, but through vastly different methods."
1980-10-28,41,"Inflation, unemployment, the cities-all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons."
1980-10-28,41,"Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons, to negotiate with the Soviet Union — balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry."
1980-10-28,41,"He has never supported any of those arms control agreements — the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the antiballistic missile treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford — and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a 7-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors."
1980-10-28,41,"And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other."
1980-10-28,41,He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty — and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form — but he also advocates the possibility-he said it's been a missing element-of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race and insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own Nation as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.
1980-10-28,41,"If President Brezhnev said, ""We will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American presidents over a 7-year period of time; we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations; and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations,"" it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans would reject such a proposition."
1980-10-28,41,This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race.
1980-10-28,41,"It would change the basic tone and commitment that our Nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with all Presidents, Democratic and Republican, and would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty."
1980-10-28,41,"It does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States; it calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other."
1980-10-28,41,She said she thought nuclear weaponry and the control of nuclear arms.
1980-10-28,41,"Mr. President, as you have said, Americans, through conservation, are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago."
1980-10-28,41,"Can the United States develop synthetic fuels and other alternative energy sources without damage to the environment, and will this process mean steadily higher fuel bills for American families?"
1980-10-28,41,"This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our Nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the conventional kinds of American energy."
1980-10-28,41,"This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our Nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the conventional kinds of American energy."
1980-10-28,41,"Governor Reagan, Americans, through conservation, are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago."
1980-10-28,41,"The question is whether the development of alternative energy sources, in order to reduce this dependence, can be done without damaging the environment, and will it mean for American families steadily higher fuel bills?"
1980-10-28,41,"But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits and so forth make it take more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe."
1980-10-28,41,"We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce."
1980-10-28,41,"Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal or to change substantially the windfall profits tax, to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies, to do away with the Department of Energy, to shortcircuit our synthetic fuels program, to put a minimal emphasis on solar power, to emphasize strongly nuclear powerplants as a major source of energy in the future."

1980-10-28,41,"And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth as Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States — the strictest air quality law that has ever been adopted in the United States."
1980-10-28,41,"And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth as Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States — the strictest air quality law that has ever been adopted in the United States."
1980-10-28,41,"As a matter of fact, the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well known fact."
1980-10-28,41,"If it is a wellknown fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California — not a law, regulations that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations."
1980-10-28,41,We still have the strictest air control or air pollution laws in the country.
1980-10-28,41,"The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations that don't presently have it, particularly the terrorist nations."
1999-01-19,13,"Thanks to the pioneering leadership of all of you, we have the lowest violent crime rate in a quarter century and the cleanest environment in a quarter century."

2009-01-12,8,I'm for a sustainable cease-fire.
2009-01-12,8,And a definition of a sustainable cease-fire is that Hamas stops firing rockets into Israel.
2009-01-12,8,And there will not be a sustainable cease-fire if they continue firing rockets.
2009-01-12,8,And we believe that the best way to ensure that there is a sustainable cease-fire is to work with Egypt to stop the smuggling of arms into the Gaza that enables Hamas to continue to fire rockets.
2009-01-12,8,"Hamas, obviously, if they're interested in a sustainable cease-fire, needs to stop arming."
2009-01-12,8,Do you remember what the environment was like in Washington?

1993-09-22,3,But we passed a budget which has Medicaid increases of between 16 and 11 percent a year over the next 5 years and Medicare increases of between 11 and 9 percent in an environment where we assume inflation will be at 4 percent or less.

1992-12-15,7,"I ask them to consider the last 4 years when a dozen dreams were made real: The Berlin Wall demolished and Germany united; the captive nations set free; Russia democratic; whole classes of nuclear weapons eliminated, the rest vastly reduced; many nations united in our historic U.N. coalition to turn back a tyrant in the Persian Gulf; Israel and its Arab neighbors for the first time talking peace, face to face, in a region that has known so much war."

1985-11-21,11,And may I add that we were especially eager that our meetings give a push to important talks already underway on reducing nuclear weapons.
1985-11-21,11, We discussed nuclear arms and how to reduce them.
1985-11-21,11," Specifically, we agreed in Geneva that each side should move to cut offensive nuclear arms by 50 percent in appropriate categories."
1985-11-21,11,"We called for an interim accord on intermediate-range nuclear forces, leading, I hope, to the complete elimination of this class of missiles—and all of this with tough verification."
1985-11-21,11,"We also made progress in combating, together, the spread of nuclear weapons, an arms control area in which we've cooperated effectively over the years."
1985-11-21,11," I described our Strategic Defense Initiative, our research effort, that envisions the possibility of defensive systems which could ultimately protect all nations against the danger of nuclear war."
1985-11-21,11,Mr. Gorbachev insisted that we might use a strategic defense system to put offensive weapons into space and establish nuclear superiority.
1985-11-21,11,"I made it clear that SDI has nothing to do with offensive weapons; that, instead, we are investigating nonnuclear defense systems that would only threaten offensive missiles, not people."
1985-11-21,11,We don't seek nuclear superiority.
1985-11-21,11,"This is why we've proposed a 50-percent reduction in the most threatening nuclear weapons, especially those that could carry out a first strike."
1985-11-21,11,"I promised that if our research reveals that a defense against nuclear missiles is possible, we would sit down with our allies and the Soviet Union to see how together we could replace all strategic ballistic missiles with such a defense, which threatens no one."
2010-03-15,2, So the bottom line is this:  The status quo on health care is simply unsustainable.
2010-03-15,2, They don’t want us putting our finger out to the wind.
2018-09-25,8,"In June, I traveled to Singapore to meet face to face with North Korea’s leader, Chairman Kim Jong Un. We had highly productive conversations and meetings, and we agreed that it was in both countries’ interest to pursue the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
2018-09-25,8,The sanctions will stay in place until denuclearization occurs.
2018-09-25,8,That is why so many countries in the Middle East strongly supported my decision to withdraw the United States from the horrible 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal and re-impose nuclear sanctions.
2018-09-25,8,The Iran deal was a windfall for Iran’s leaders.
2018-09-25,8,"The dictatorship used the funds to build nuclear-capable missiles, increase internal repression, finance terrorism, and fund havoc and slaughter in Syria and Yemen."

2018-09-25,8,"The United States stands ready to export our abundant, affordable supply of oil, clean coal, and natural gas."
1988-09-26,9,"And another change, Mr. Secretary-General, a change that, if it endures, may go down as one of the signal accomplishments of our history, a change that is a cause for shaking of the head in wonder, is also upon us—a change going to the source of postwar tensions and to the once seemingly impossible dream of ending the twin threats of our time: totalitarianism and thermonuclear world war."
1988-09-26,9,"And these negotiations, some of them under U.N. auspices, involve a broad arms control agenda—strategic offensive weapons and space, nuclear testing and chemical warfare—whose urgency we have witnessed anew in recent days."
1988-09-26,9,"Only recently, when the United States and the Soviet Union signed the INF agreement, an entire class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles was eliminated for the first time in history."
1988-09-26,9,"Even on the arms control issue itself, we agreed to go beyond the past, to seek not just treaties that permit building weapons to higher levels but revolutionary agreements that actually reduced and even eliminated a whole class of nuclear weapons."
1988-09-26,9,"Indeed, the invasion of Afghanistan and the apparent will among democratic and peace-loving nations to deter such events seemed to cause a climate where aggression by nations large and small was epidemic, a climate the world has not seen since the 1930's."
1988-09-26,9,"So, too, our discussions on nuclear testing and defense and space have been useful."
1988-09-26,9,"But let me here stress to this General Assembly that much of the momentum in nuclear arms control negotiations is due to technological progress itself, especially in the potential for space-based defensive systems."
1988-09-26,9,"And yet, even as diplomatic and technological progress holds out the hope of at last diminishing the awful cloud of nuclear terror we've lived under in the postwar era, even at this moment another ominous terror is loose once again in the world, a terror we thought the world had put behind, a terror that looms at us now from the long-buried past, from ghostly, scarring trenches and the haunting, wan faces of millions dead in one of the most inhumane conflicts of all time: poison gas, chemical warfare."
1988-09-26,9,"Finally, Mr. Secretary-General, we must redouble our efforts to stop further proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world."
1982-01-26,5,"The record is clear, and I believe that history will remember this as an era of American renewal, remember this administration as an administration of change, and remember this Congress as a Congress of destiny."
1982-01-26,5,"When I took office, there were approximately 500, costing nearly a hundred billion dollars—13 programs for energy, 36 for pollution control, 66 for social services, 90 for education."
1982-01-26,5,We look forward to the enactment of a responsible clean air act to increase jobs while continuing to improve the quality of our air.
1982-01-26,5,We have proposed to the Soviet Union a far-reaching agenda for mutual reduction of military forces and have already initiated negotiations with them in Geneva on intermediate-range nuclear forces.

2010-09-23,12,"Earlier this year, 47 nations embraced a work-plan to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within four years."
2010-09-23,12, We have reduced the role of nuclear weapons in our security strategy.
2010-09-23,12,"Iran is the only party to the NPT that cannot demonstrate the peaceful intentions of its nuclear program, and those actions have consequences."
2010-09-23,12, But the Iranian government must demonstrate a clear and credible commitment and confirm to the world the peaceful intent of its nuclear program.
2010-09-23,12,"As we combat the spread of deadly weapons, we’re also confronting the specter of climate change."
2010-09-23,12," After making historic investments in clean energy and efficiency at home, we helped forge an accord in Copenhagen that -- for the first time -- commits all major economies to reduce their emissions."

1986-10-13,14,"Before I report on our talks, though, allow me to set the stage by explaining two things that were very much a part of our talks: one a treaty and the other a defense against nuclear missiles, which we're trying to develop."
1986-10-13,14,"Some years ago, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to limit any defense against nuclear missile attacks to the emplacement in one location in each country of a small number of missiles capable of intercepting and shooting down incoming nuclear missiles, thus leaving our real defense—a policy called mutual assured destruction , meaning if one side launched a nuclear attack, the other side could retaliate."
1986-10-13,14,"So here we sit, with thousands of nuclear warheads targeted on each other and capable of wiping out both our countries."
1986-10-13,14,"Believing that a policy of mutual destruction and slaughter of their citizens and ours was uncivilized, I asked our military, a few years ago, to study and see if there was a practical way to destroy nuclear missiles after their launch but before they can reach their targets, rather than to just destroy people."
1986-10-13,14,"SDI, let me make it clear, is a nonnuclear defense."
1986-10-13,14,"In the first, and in the months in between, we have discussed ways to reduce and in fact eliminate nuclear weapons entirely."
1986-10-13,14,We and the Soviets have had teams of negotiators in Geneva trying to work out a mutual agreement on how we could reduce or eliminate nuclear weapons.
1986-10-13,14,"I explained that even though we would have done away with our offensive ballistic missiles, having the defense would protect against cheating or the possibility of a madman, sometime, deciding to create nuclear missiles."
1986-10-13,14,"In an effort to see how we could satisfy their concerns—while protecting our principles and security—we proposed a 10-year period in which we began with the reduction of all strategic nuclear arms, bombers, airlaunched cruise missiles, intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and the weapons they carry."
1986-10-13,14,"And unless I agreed, all that work toward eliminating nuclear weapons would go down the drain—canceled."
1986-10-13,14,"I told him I had pledged to the American people that I would not trade away SDI, there was no way I could tell our people their government would not protect them against nuclear destruction."
